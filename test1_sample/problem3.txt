int minProduct(int[] A)
    N = length(A)
    minProduct = INFINITY
    for i from 0 to (N - 2)
        for j from (i + 1) to (N - 1)
            if (A[i] * A[j] < minProduct)
                minProduct = A[i] * A[j]
    return minProduct


The time complexity of this program is O(N^2), since it is nested loop, it runs 2 loop


**THE BETTER ALGORITHM**

I think the better algorithm is we sort the array first, and then the 2 first element
is the minimum multiplication
